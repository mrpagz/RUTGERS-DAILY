# Event Bubbling
## Instructions
* Study the file called `index.html`: 
  1. When the `child1` button is clicked, the background color of parent should be red.
  2. When the `child2` button is clicked, the background color of parent should be green and the background color of the body should remain unchanged (* hint - you must stop propagation).
  3. When the `clear` button is clicked the background color of the body should be white.
  4. When the `parent` button is clicked (*hint - its clicked via event bubbling*) the background color of the body should be black.
